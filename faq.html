							<h2>Participation and Equipment</h3>
							<h4>Boards</h4>
							<p>Any Onewheel (single tire) self-balancing electric “trailboard” is allowed and any modification is accepted. Models allowed include VESC, Pint, XR, GT, Trotter, Magwheel and Floatwheel. The board must be ridden like a skateboard (sideways riding). EUCs do not qualify. There are no board classes, race what you bring!</p>
							<h4>Equipment</h4>
							<p>At a minimum, riders should bring their Onewheel (or allowed equivalent), a mobile phone with the Ride Hermes app installed, a helmet, and any other personal safety gear. Additional items such as water, snacks, and basic tools are recommended.</p>	
							<h4>Divisions</h4>
							<p>Men’s, Women’s, Clydesdale (215lbs+), Legends (50+)</p>
							<h4>Time Validation</h4>
							<p>We understand concerns related to racing on a non supervised GPS based course. Race validation can be requested for any time in question. Validation can be done through Ride Hermes review, video evidence, witnesses and / or a re-race. POV video is not required, but recommended.​</p>
							<h4>Course</h4>
							<p>It is the riders responsibility to know the course. Courses MUST be raced as designed and any deviation from the course or “gaming” the trail is not allowed. Any race times that don’t meet the course requirements, intentional or unintentional, will be removed.</p>
							<h4>Starting</h4>
							<p>Rolling starts. If safe to do so, roll through the start gate at speed, rather than starting from a standstill. </p>
							<h4>Etiquette</h4>
							<p>Please read our trail edtiquette guidlines <a href="https://floatuckytrailderby.com/trail-etiquette/">here</a></p>
