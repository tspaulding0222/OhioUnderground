							<h2>General Information</h2>
							<h3>What is The Underground Circuit?</h3>
							<p>The <a href="https://www.theundergroundrace.com/" target="_blank">Underground Circuit</a> is a Onewheel Racing Competition using GPS Mobile Phone tracking. "Circuits" are organized by the community and set across the United States. Each Circuit is made up of designated "Trails" that are raced for time during a three month season. Ohio Underground is the official Underground Circuit for Ohio.</p>
							<p>All you need is a mobile phone and the free <a href="https://ridehermes.app/landing" target="_blank">Ride Hermes app</a> to find Underground Trails. Record your rides and race as much as much as you want. Your fastest time will automatically be recorded to our live Underground Leaderboard in the app. The faster you go, the more points you earn. The more trails you race, the more points you collect. It's that simple!</p>
							<p>And here's the best part—you're not just racing the clock; you can also race yourself, challenge a friend, or even go head-to-head with a local pro. The Underground Circuit is more than just a leaderboard; it's a chance to test your skills, push your limits, and experience the thrill of Onewheel racing at your own pace. Whether you're chasing personal bests or battling it out with top riders, every run is an opportunity to grow and elevate the stoke of the sport.</p>

							<h3>Ohio Underground 2025 Season</h3>
							<p><strong>Tentative Dates:</strong><br>
							Regular Season: May 2nd – August 3rd<br>
							Finals: August 24th</p>

							<h3>Future Seasons</h3>
							<p>Season dates are typically announced by February each year, with the specific locations and trails revealed just before the season begins. This ensures a fair competition by preventing racers from gaining an unfair advantage through pre-season practice.</p>
							<p>For the most up-to-date announcements, join our Ohio Underground community social media channels, where the majority of updates are shared. Stay tuned and follow us to stay in the loop!</p>

							<h3>Ride Hermes App</h3>
							<p>The <a href="https://ridehermes.app/landing" target="_blank">Ride Hermes app</a> is our official tool for timing and recording your rides. It uses GPS tracking to automatically record your fastest runs on designated trails, update the live leaderboard, and award points based on your performance.</p>

							<h2>Participation and Equipment</h2>
							<h3>Boards</h3>
							<p>Any Onewheel (single tire) self-balancing electric "trailboard" is allowed and any modification is accepted. Models allowed include VESC, Pint, XR, GT, Trotter, Magwheel and Floatwheel. The board must be ridden like a skateboard (sideways riding). EUCs do not qualify. There are no board classes, race what you bring!</p>
							
							<h3>Equipment</h3>
							<p>At a minimum, riders should bring their Onewheel (or allowed equivalent), a mobile phone with the Ride Hermes app installed, a helmet, and any other personal safety gear. Additional items such as water, snacks, and basic tools are recommended.</p>
							
							<h3>Divisions</h3>
							<p>Men's<br>
							Women's<br>
							Clydesdale (215lbs+)<br>
							Legends (50+)</p>
							
							<h3>Time Validation</h3>
							<p>We understand concerns related to racing on a non supervised GPS based course. Race validation can be requested for any time in question. Validation can be done through Ride Hermes review, video evidence, witnesses and / or a re-race. POV video is not required, but recommended.</p>
							
							<h3>GPS Errors</h3>
							<p>It's our goal to limit errors through proper design of race trails, but some errors are unavoidable. Any race times that show an unfair advantage due to error will be removed.</p>
							<p>Some trails do not record correctly for various reasons. The organizers will monitor each trail for errors and reserve the right to adjust or remove any trail if it isn't recording properly. These adjustments can alter standings and race times. Any adjustment shall be done prior to the halfway point in the season.</p>
							
							<h3>Course</h3>
							<p>It is the riders responsibility to know the course. Courses MUST be raced as designed and any deviation from the course or "gaming" the trail is not allowed. Any race times that don't meet the course requirements, intentional or unintentional, will be removed.</p>
							
							<h3>Starting</h3>
							<p>Rolling starts. If safe to do so, roll through the start gate at speed, rather than starting from a standstill.</p>
							
							<h3>Etiquette</h3>
							<p>Please practice good trail etiquette when riding and racing. Respect other trail users, stay on designated trails, and follow all local park rules and regulations.</p>

							<h3>Leaderboards</h3>
							<p>Live leaderboard standings can be seen on the <a href="https://ridehermes.app/" target="_blank">Ride Hermes webpage</a> or the Ride Hermes app!</p>

							<h3>Beginners</h3>
							<p>Absolutely! Ohio Underground events are designed to be inclusive. Whether you're a seasoned racer or just starting out, you're welcome to join the fun. We encourage new riders to connect with our community and take part in meetups for tips and guidance.</p>

							<h3>Safety</h3>
							<p>We require all racers to adhere to our official safety guidelines. These include wearing a helmet, riding within your skill level, and following trail etiquette.</p>

							<h2>Scoring and Awards</h2>
							<h3>Scoring</h3>
							<p>Locations are established across Ohio, some with grouped trails. Points are awarded per location. Locations with only a single trail have leaderboards based on the fastest times on that trail. Locations with grouped trails have leaderboards based on a combined time of the trails at that location. Riders must complete all designated trails at a location to be added to that specific location's leaderboard. The higher a rider places on the location leaderboard, the more points they receive.</p>
							<p>A riders top seven locations apply towards overall standings. This is based on placement. Any locations ranked below the top seven will be uncounted until placement improves or other locations placements drop below the uncounted location. 1st place at a single location does not guarantee entry into Finals, so lay down your best time at as many locations as possible to maximize points.</p>
							<p>Once the season concludes, the top riders on the overall standings will be invited to the Ohio Underground Finals.</p>
							<p>Ohio Underground Finals is a single-day event where the top riders battle for the Title and Trophies at a new location in Ohio.</p>
							<p>The top three Male, Female and Clydesdale division riders from the Ohio Underground finals will be invited to the Underground Finals to race against the fastest riders from the collective circuits.</p>

							<h3>Awards</h3>
							<p>At the Ohio Underground Finals, the top three racers in each division are honored with unique trophies, symbolizing the spirit of Ohio racing. In addition, sponsor-provided prizes are distributed to racers at the end of the season.</p>
							<p>Riders can also earn exclusive award pins, which recognize not just racing achievements but also riding milestones and contributions to the community.</p>

							<h2>Events and Volunteering</h2>
							<h3>Events</h3>
							<p>Ohio Underground hosts several exciting events throughout the year:</p>
							<p><strong>Trail Ride Meetups:</strong> During each active race season, we organize group rides at official race locations, hosted by local Ohio Underground Ambassadors. These meetups offer a chance to explore trails with a local expert and enjoy the day with fellow riders—whether you're pushing for your fastest laps or just riding for fun and camaraderie.</p>
							<p><strong>Ohio Underground Finals:</strong> At the season's end, we hold the annual Finals event, where top racers compete for trophies and bragging rights. This highly attended event is open to all, not just finalists, and includes additional activities and community celebration. It's a celebration of the season and community.</p>
							<p><strong>Off-Season Events:</strong> We also organize trail scouting days where riders explore new locations, test trails, and add favorites to the Ride Hermes app for future seasons.</p>
							<p><strong>Sponsoring Local Events:</strong> Occasionally, we support other local gatherings to further grow the community. Our events bring racers and enthusiasts together for competition, fun, and shared passion for the trails!</p>
